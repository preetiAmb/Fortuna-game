# Fortuna-game

The Fortuna-game needs a good algorithm to create a Fortuna game for their slot machines.
So to test if the game works properly, we will write code for it.

The game uses the currency pix.
The task:
• The player starts with 500 pix
• Game round:
o The player bets pix (at least 50 pix)
o The player chooses a lucky number (1-6)
o Three dice are rolled
o If a dice shows the lucky number, you get to double the bet
o If two dice show, you get the bet three times
o If all the dice show the lucky number, you get the bet four times.

• Rules
o The player may not bet more than he has on the bank
o The player must not cheat and bet negative values
o If the player's account is less than 50 pix, the game ends
o After one round, the player can see his balance and choose whether he wants to run another round
